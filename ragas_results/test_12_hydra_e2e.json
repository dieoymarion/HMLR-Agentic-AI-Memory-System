  "reasoning_text": "\ud83d\udcac Response: The answer \"NON-COMPLIANT\" for using Tartarus-v3 (also known as Styx/Charon/River-9/etc.) for Project Cerberus\u2019s production encryption workload of approximately 4.85 million records per day is based on the following detailed logic and policy facts:\n\n1. **Current Enforceable Policy Limit (Policy v6):**  \n   The official and enforceable policy currently in effect is Policy version 6, which limits the usage of Tartarus-v3 (the Legacy-Phi encryption scheme internally codenamed L\u03a6-88) to 400,000 records per day. This policy explicitly supersedes all earlier limits and draft policies except for the retracted ones.\n\n2. **Supersession and Retraction of Other Policies:**  \n   - Policy v7, which imposed a global ban on Tartarus-v3 for workloads exceeding 1 GiB/day, was identified as issued by a rogue employee and has been fully rescinded.  \n   - Policy v5, a draft limiting usage to 2.5 GB/day, is to be ignored.  \n   - Policy v4 allowed unlimited use in EU regions only, but this is superseded by v6 globally.  \n   Therefore, the only valid limit is the 400,000 records/day from Policy v6.\n\n3. **Tartarus-v3 Naming and Capacity Context:**  \n   - Tartarus-v3 is the only supported name for the Legacy-Phi scheme after March 1st, 2025.  \n   - It is the final production name, also known as Charon internally, and corresponds to the Legacy-Phi cipher (L\u03a6-88), which is the older Phoenix cipher from 2019.  \n   - The newer production cipher, Styx (also known as Aether/K-12/River-9), supports much higher capacity and throughput (e.g., up to 500 TiB/day and 10,000 objects per second).\n\n4. **Project Cerberus Workload vs. Policy Limits:**  \n   - Project Cerberus has a final steady-state encryption workload capacity of approximately 4,850,000 records per day.  \n   - This workload is more than an order of magnitude greater than the 400,000 records/day limit for Tartarus-v3.  \n   - Using Tartarus-v3 alone for the entire production workload would therefore exceed the policy limits by a wide margin.\n\n5. **Implications for Compliance:**  \n   - Compliance requires that any usage of Tartarus-v3 must not exceed 400,000 records per day.  \n   - Since Cerberus\u2019s workload is ~4.85 million records/day, using Tartarus-v3 for the full load violates the policy.  \n   - The correct compliant approach is to use the high-capacity cipher Styx (Aether/K-12/River-9) for the bulk of encryption workload and restrict Tartarus-v3 usage within its allowed limit.\n\n6. **Summary:**  \n   Because the required daily encryption record count for Cerberus is significantly above the permitted limit for Tartarus-v3 usage under Policy v6, and no current policy allows exceeding that limit, it is therefore **NON-COMPLIANT** for Project Cerberus to use Tartarus-v3 as its production cipher for the full 4.85 million records per day workload.\n\nIf you need, I can help plan a compliant encryption architecture that partitions workloads between Styx and Tartarus-v3 or provide compliance monitoring tools to enforce these limits.\n\nNo changes to the Bridge Block metadata are needed.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Context efficiency: 100.0%",
